# Naïve Bayes Spam Classifier
1. What is the effect of removing stop words in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy?
Show a plot or a table of these results.
2. Experiment on the number of words used for training. Filter the dictionary to include only
words occurring more than k times (1000 words, then k > 100, and k = 50 times). For
example, the word “offer” appears 150 times, that means that it will be included in the
dictionary.
3. Discuss the results of the different parameters used for Lambda smoothing. Test it on 5
varying values of the λ (e.g. λ = 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.005), Evaluate performance metrics
for each.
4. What are your recommendations to further improve the model?
